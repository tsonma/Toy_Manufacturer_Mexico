## Project Objectives - Answered

- Can you create a scorecard that provides an overview of the company's performance in sales?

In the Power BI file titled "Dashboard", there is a report called "Scorecard". It shows that the toy manufacturer in Mexico achieved 16% higher profitability from January to September 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

Additionally:

All four store locations (Downtown, Commercial, Residential, and Airport) experienced double-digit growth, except for the Commercial location, which grew by 8.5%.

The company heavily relies on its Downtown location, which contributes 56.7% of the company's total profit.

- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

The "Arts & Crafts" product category is the most profitable, contributing 26.3% of the company’s profit in 2023.
The "Toys" product category is the second most profitable, contributing 25.8% of the company’s profit in 2023.

Across all store locations:
"Arts & Crafts" and "Toys" are consistently the top two performing categories.
"Electronics" ranks third in most locations, except at the Airport, where it drops to fourth.
This information is detailed in the report titled "Details".

- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

In both 2022 and 2023, August was the least profitable month.
In both 2022 and 2023, February was less profitable than January
In 2022, sales showed an upward trend during the end of Q3 and Q4 (September to December), likely due to aggressive promotions such as Back to School, Black Friday, Boxing Week, and End-of-Year Clearance.
