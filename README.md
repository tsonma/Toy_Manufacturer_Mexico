Mexico Toy Sales
Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

Questions to answer
- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

Approach
- Clean the data in Python using Jupyter notebook on Visual Studio Code
- Visualize the data using Microsoft Power BI
